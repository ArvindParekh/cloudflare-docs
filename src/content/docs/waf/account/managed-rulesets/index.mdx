## Account-level deployment

At the account level, you can deploy each [WAF managed ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) more than once. This means that you can apply the same managed ruleset with different configurations to different subsets of incoming traffic for the Enterprise zones in your account.

For example, you could deploy the [Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/) multiple times with different paranoia levels and a different action (_Log_ action for PL4 and _Managed Challenge_ action for PL3). Refer to [Example OWASP configuration](/waf/account/managed-rulesets/owasp-example/) for details on how to set up this configuration.

		overridesUrl:
			"/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset",
