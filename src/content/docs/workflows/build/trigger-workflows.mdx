## Workers API (Bindings)

You can interact with Workflows programmatically from any Worker script by creating a binding to a Workflow. A Worker can bind to multiple Workflows, including Workflows defined in other Workers projects (scripts) within your account.

You can interact with a Workflow:

* Directly over HTTP via the [`fetch`](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/) handler
* From a [Queue consumer](/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#consumer) inside a `queue` handler
* From a [Cron Trigger](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/) inside a `scheduled` handler
* Within a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/).

:::note

New to Workflows? Start with the [Workflows tutorial](/workflows/get-started/guide/) to deploy your first Workflow and familiarize yourself with Workflows concepts.

:::

To bind to a Workflow from your Workers code, you need to define a [binding](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to a specific Workflow. For example, to bind to the Workflow defined in the [get started guide](/workflows/get-started/guide/), you would configure a `wrangler.toml` with the below:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "workflows-tutorial"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-15"

[[workflows]]
# The name of the Workflow
name = "workflows-tutorial"
# The binding name, which must be a valid JavaScript variable name.  This will
# be how you call (run) your Workflow from your other Workers handlers or
# scripts.
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
 # script_name is required during for the beta.
 # Must match the "name" of your Worker at the top of wrangler.toml
script_name = "workflows-tutorial"
# Must match the class defined in your code that extends the Workflow class
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
```

The `binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"` line defines the JavaScript variable that our Workflow methods are accessible on, including `create` (which triggers a new instance) or `get` (which returns the status of an existing instance).

```ts title="src/index.ts"
interface Env {
	MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
}

export default {
	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
        // 
        const instanceId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("instanceId")

        // If an ?instanceId=<id> query parameter is provided, fetch the status
        // of an existing Workflow by its ID.
        if (instanceId) {
            let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(id);
			return Response.json({
				status: await instance.status(),
			});
        }

        // Else, create a new instance of our Workflow, passing in any (optional) params
        // and return the ID.
		const newId = await crypto.randomUUID();
		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create(newId, {});
		return Response.json({
			id: instance.id,
			details: await instance.status(),
		});

		return Response.json({ result });
	},
};
```
